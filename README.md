# Baseline Setup

This is the baseline setup I do in all my machines. Registered here so anyone could use it as well.

# MacOS

In MacOS I'd install oh-my-zsh and change some stuff around. 
First I'd clone this repo on my `~/Source` folder, then link the `.zshrc` file to `~/.zshrc`:
```shell
ln -s ~/Source/baseline-setup/zsh/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
